# Quality Frameworks

## Good Therapy Content Characteristics

- Accessible without being dumbed down
- Evidence-based without being academic
- Warm without being saccharine
- Direct without being harsh
- Curious without being leading
- Specific without being prescriptive
- Nuanced without being wishy-washy
- Conversational without being unprofessional

## Red Flags in Content

- Sounds like it's talking to children
- Makes promises it can't keep
- Oversimplifies complex issues
- Uses therapy as aesthetic, not substance
- Assumes everyone has same struggles
- Pathologizes normal human experiences

## Good Headlines

A great headline has 2-3 of these qualities:
1. **CURIOSITY** - Makes you want to know more
2. **CLARITY** - You know what you're getting
3. **BENEFIT** - Clear value proposition

### Good Examples
- "The Conversation Most Couples Avoid"
- "How to Apologize Without Making It Worse"
- "Why Your Arguments Feel So Personal"

### Avoid
- Clickbait ("You Won't Believe...")
- All caps or excessive punctuation
- Vague promises ("Transform Your Life")
- Generic questions
- Over 80 characters

## Good Pull Quotes

A pull quote should be:
- **COMPLETE** - Makes sense out of context
- **QUOTABLE** - Someone would share this
- **SUBSTANTIVE** - Has real insight
- **CONCISE** - 15-40 words ideal
- **VOICE** - Sounds like a real person

### Good Quote Types
- Reframes common thinking
- Names something unnamed
- Offers specific advice
- Challenges assumptions
- Reveals vulnerability
- Makes complex simple (without oversimplifying)

### Bad Quotes to Avoid
- "I think that's interesting" (filler)
- "As I was saying..." (context-dependent)
- "Yeah, exactly" (not substantive)
- Long rambling quotes (not concise)
