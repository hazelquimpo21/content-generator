**Voice Guidelines:**
{{VOICE_GUIDELINES}}

## Task

Create a high-level outline for a 750-word blog post based on this episode.

### Narrative Summary (IMPORTANT)

First, write a **narrative_summary** - a 3-4 sentence paragraph that captures:
- What this blog post is about (the core message)
- The main argument or insight
- What the reader will take away

This summary is used by the draft writer to understand the "big picture" before writing.

**Example narrative_summary:**
"This blog post explores why couples often avoid difficult conversations about money, even when
financial stress is damaging their relationship. Drawing from attachment theory, we'll examine
how early experiences shape our comfort with financial vulnerability. Readers will learn that
the goal isn't to eliminate disagreements about money, but to create safety for honest dialogue."

### Structure Requirements

1. **HOOK** (75-100 words)
   - How to open the post
   - NOT a rhetorical question
   - NOT "In this post, I'll..."
   - Specific approach: anecdote, bold statement, named problem

2. **CONTEXT** (100-150 words)
   - Why this topic matters
   - Common misconceptions or pain points
   - What's at stake

3. **MAIN SECTIONS** (400-500 words total, 3-4 sections)
   - Each section needs: title, purpose, word count target
   - Sections should flow logically
   - Balance theory and practical application

4. **TAKEAWAY** (75-100 words)
   - How to close meaningfully
   - NOT just repeating what was said
   - One clear thing to think about or try
   - NOT a hard sell

## Quality Requirements

- Total word count: 720-780 (target 750)
- Hook avoids gimmicks and rhetorical questions
- Each section advances the conversation
- 3-4 sections (not more)
- CTA is meaningful, not pushy

**Hooks to avoid:**
- "Have you ever wondered..."
- "In today's world..."
- "Imagine if..."
- "Let's talk about..."
