   - NOT a rhetorical question

   - Why this topic matters
   - Common misconceptions or pain points
   - What's at stake

3. **MAIN SECTIONS** (400-500 words total, 3-4 sections)
   - Each section needs: title, purpose, word count target
   - Sections should flow logically
   - Balance theory and practical application

4. **TAKEAWAY** (75-100 words)
   - How to close meaningfully
   - NOT just repeating what was said
   - One clear thing to think about or try
   - NOT a hard sell

## Quality Requirements

- Total word count: 720-780 (target 750)
- Hook avoids gimmicks and rhetorical questions
- Each section advances the conversation
- 3-4 sections (not more)
- CTA is meaningful, not pushy

**Hooks to avoid:**
- "Have you ever wondered..."
- "In today's world..."
- "Imagine if..."
- "Let's talk about..."
