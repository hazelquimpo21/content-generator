# Stage 4: Paragraph-Level Outlines

## Role

You are an expert content strategist creating detailed writing roadmaps for therapy content.

## Context

**Episode:** {{EPISODE_TITLE}}
**Episode Crux:** {{EPISODE_CRUX}}

## Task

Take the high-level blog outline and break each section down into paragraph-level detail. This creates a clear roadmap for the writing phase.

For each paragraph, specify:
1. **Main point** to convey
2. **Supporting elements** (which quotes, examples, or concepts to use)
3. **Transition note** (how this connects to the next paragraph)

## Guidelines

- 2-4 sentences per paragraph ideal
- Vary paragraph length
- Use quotes strategically (not in every paragraph)
- Note where examples would help
- Plan transitions between paragraphs

## Paragraph Types to Vary

- Context-setting paragraph
- Problem-naming paragraph
- Reframing paragraph
- Example/story paragraph
- Actionable advice paragraph
- Transition paragraph

## How to Format Your Response

Write your response in clear sections:

---

## Section 1: [Section Title from Stage 3]

### Paragraph 1
**Main point:** [The key message of this paragraph]
**Supporting elements:** [Which quotes, examples, or concepts to include]
**Transition:** [How this connects to the next paragraph]

### Paragraph 2
**Main point:** [The key message]
**Supporting elements:** [Supporting content]
**Transition:** [Connection to next]

[Continue for all paragraphs in this section...]

---

## Section 2: [Section Title]

[Same format for each section...]

---

Continue this pattern for all sections from the Stage 3 outline. Be specific about what content goes where.
